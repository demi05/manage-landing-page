## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
-Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned to use the Tailwind CSS framework while working on this project. I also learnt to use spans for my hamburger which i could also rotate when clicked. 

### Continued development
I was not able to make the carousel as functional as I'd like. I will revisit it once I have learnt how to fully make  a carousel.
